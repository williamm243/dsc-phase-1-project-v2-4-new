## Conclusion
1. Over the years the domestic gross generated from movies has been increasing thus investing in a movie studio would be a good move for our stake holders.
2.Microsoft may choose to partner with BV,Uni.,WB, Fox and Sony studios because they made the best domestic gross so money invested in a movie together with these companies is likely to generate more profits.
3.There is no relationship between the length of title of a movie and its income return therefore microsoft can make their movie titles as creative as they wish.
4 .Microsoft should consider making Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi Action,Adventure,Fantasy Adventure,Animation,Comedy Drama Comedy,Drama,Romance Action,Adventure,Comedy movies because they had over 7 million votes which means most people would prefer them
